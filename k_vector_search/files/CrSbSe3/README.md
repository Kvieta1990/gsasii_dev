- The `PG3_42704-2_10K.dat` is the low temperature data where we have those magnetic peaks popping up.

- The `PG3_42702-2_300K.dat` is the high temperature data.

- The instrument parameter file `2020A_HighRes_60HzB2_CWL1p5.instprm` is from a different cycle but I suppose it should not be too far off.

- The `CrSbSe3.cif` is the nucleus structure.
